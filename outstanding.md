* The list subscribers join table has a cascade on delete setting. This means that when the list is deleted, so too are all associated entries in the table. However, the subscribers table is unaffected and may contain emails that have no association in list subscribers. This isn't particularly egregious as they may be reused at a later time, but it should be addressed at some point.
